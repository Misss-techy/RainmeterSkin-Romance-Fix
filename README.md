# RainmeterSkin-Romance-Fix

The Uploaded files will offer a Quick and easy fix to the "Romance" Rainmeter weather skin built by ApexXx-SenSei on Devian art. I have also added "Spotify" as one of the player on this altered skin.  

## Steps to Fix Weather Skin

#### 1. Download the altered files from github rep.

#### 2. Go to this Folder path - Rainmeter\Skins\Romance 
   
#### 3. Replace Files

#### 4. Load your settings.ini skin

#### 5. Refresh your Skin

For Spotify, Choose your player as spotify in settings.ini. Replace the Older "Player" folder with newly Downloaded "Player" folder and refresh the skin.




I do not own any of these skins. It all belongs to apexxxx-sensei. You can view his orginal works by clicking the link below.
