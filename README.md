# RainmeterSkin-Romance-Fix
Hey y'all !!!

The Uploaded files will offer a Quick and easy fix to the Rainmeter weather skin built by ApexXx-SenSei on Devian art. I have also added "Spotify" as one of the player on this altered skin.  

## Steps to Fix Weather Skin
### 1. Download the altered files from github rep.
### 2. Go to Rainmeter\Skins\Romance Path
        Go to the File Location on your Pc Where the Rainmeter skins are all loaded. Most often it will be located on Documents\Rainmeter\Skins\Romance\. If you cannot find the location, do a quick search for "Skins" or "Romance". I hope you found the path
