# RainmeterSkin-Romance-Fix
Hey y'all !!!

The Uploaded files will offer a Quick and easy fix to the "Romance" Rainmeter weather skin built by ApexXx-SenSei on Devian art. I have also added "Spotify" as one of the player on this altered skin (If you want em').  

## Steps to Fix Weather Skin

#### 1. Download the altered files from github rep.

#### 2. Go to this Folder path - Rainmeter\Skins\Romance 
   Go to the File Location on your Pc Where the Rainmeter skins are all loaded. Most often it will be located on Documents\Rainmeter\Skins\Romance\. If you cannot find the location, do a quick search for "Skins" or "Romance" on your windows search. I hope you found it...
   
#### 3. Replace Files
   Replace the Older files with newly uploaded files. Replace "Weater Info" and "Settings" folder with newly Downloaded files.
   
   Ex: Delete the older "Weather Info" folder and place the new "Weather Info" folder from your downloads.
   
#### 4. Load your settings.ini skin
   Choose your Weather code from https://openweathermap.org/find. You will be able to find the code for your city in the url (after you hit the search with your city location).
   EX: After I searched for london on the Search engine. I was redirected to this link "https://openweathermap.org/city/2643743". So, "2643743" is my city code for london.
   
   Type the Weather code in your settings skin. You can choose either "Metric" or "Imperial" of your Choice. Close the settings.

#### 5. Refresh your Skin
   Voila ! You FIXED IT !!!
   

For Spotify, Choose your player as spotify in settings.ini. Replace the Older "Player" folder with newly Downloaded "Player" folder.
